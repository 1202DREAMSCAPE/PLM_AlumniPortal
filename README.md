# Alumni Portal

The system entitled _**PLM Alumni Portal**_, prepared and submitted by Mary Janelly S. Borbon, Christelle Joyce M. Cerezo, Marevil E. Catugas, Pauline Regina J. Obispo, and Kaye Alex M. Pascual in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Bachelor of Science in Computer Science, has been examined and is recommended for acceptance and approval for oral examination.

# Background and Context of the Alumni Portal
  An alumni portal represents a significant advancement in how universities manage and maintain their connections with current and former students. Traditionally, universities have relied on manual record-keeping systems to track the activities and personal information of their student body, including alumni. This process of collecting, updating, and retrieving data can be time-consuming, error-prone, and challenging, particularly as the student and alumni populations expand over time. Hence, the development of an alumni portal has become essential for building strong, lasting connections with alumni and fostering a sense of community within the university.

  The alumni portal typically includes features like user profiles, alumni-related news and updates, job postings, event schedules, and donation platforms. Moreover, the portal can integrate with the university's current systems, leading to more efficient data management processes, enhance data security, and ensure compliance to privacy regulations. This digital platform improves the efficiency and effectiveness of alumni relations and can be a valuable tool for both alumni and the university.

# Scope and expected outcomes of the Project

This project aims to enhance the current alumni portal by adding new features and functions. Specifically, it aims to:
1. Validate user registration by checking it with the student information records database.
2. Incorporate the CRS (Campus Records System) alumni accounts into the alumni portal. Old alumni are requested to enter their student identification numbers during the registration process, after which their accounts will be automatically retrieved from the student information database.
3. Improve Search Engine Optimization (SEO) for the portalâ€™s webpage by optimizing the portal's content and metadata to make it more search engine-friendly.
4. Create an internal job posting feature for alumni and offer employers a platform to post job opportunities directly on the portal.
5. Develop standardized data sharing protocols to ease integration between systems involved and their databases.
6. Implement a document request feature, allowing alumni to request transcripts, diplomas, or other documents to the university.
7. Develop a clear data privacy agreement that users must acknowledge during the registration process.
8. Implement an account settings feature that provides alumni with the ability to modify and personalize their profiles, while also allowing them to manage the privacy of their profile.
9. Fix the survey link and ensure that it directs users to the intended survey form.
10. Integrate news and events sections from the main university website into the alumni portal
11. Use CAPTCHA or reCAPTCHA to deter automated or bot registrations.
